Usage
=====

To create a MongoDB databank, use the `Databank.get()` method:

    var Databank = require('databank').Databank;

    var db = Databank.get('mongodb', {});

The driver takes the following parameters:

* `host`: the host to connect to. Defaults to `localhost`.
* `port`: the port to connect to. Defaults to `27017`.
* `dbname`: the database to use. Defaults to `test`.
* `dbuser`: the username. Defaults to null, meaning no authentication.
* `dbpass`: the password. Defaults to null.
* `schema`: the database schema, as described in the Databank README.
* `checkSchema`: whether to synchronize the database with the schema
  argument at connection time. Defaults to `true`.
* `rs_name`: replica set name to use. If this is set, `host` and `port`
   are ignored.
* `hosts`: array of hosts in the replica set you want to connect to.
  These can be either arrays of [host, port] or strings (meaning use
  the default port).

Database structures
===================

Databank "types" map to MongoDB collections.

The "pkey" of a schema will be mapped to the _id value in the
database. For example, consider a schema with a single type, like the
following:

    {"person": {"pkey": "username"}}

An object like the following:

    {"username": "evanp", "age": 43}

...would be stored in the database as:

    {"_id": "evanp", "age": 43}

The "indices" in a schema will be used to create indices in the
database.

Simple types
============

Arrays and integers are stored in wrapped objects. The following call
creates a new array:

    var db = Databank.get("mongo", {});

    db.connect({}, function(err) {
        db.create("friends", "frodo", ["sam", "merry", "pippin"], function(err, friendsList) {
           // done
        });
    });

The stored object in the "friends" collection in MongoDB looks like:

    {"_id": "frodo", "_v": ["sam", "merry", "pippin"], "_s": true}

Here, the value is stored in the "_v" field, and the "_s" field stores
a flag indicating that we've made a little shim.

Similarly for integer types:

    db.incr("age", "evanp", function(err, newAge) { });

The stored object will be:

    {"_id": "evanp", "_v": 43, "_s": true}

Atomic changes are made for most of the methods.
